2. Credit Card Transactions: The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. I used it to detect frauds using Local Outlier Factor(LOF).[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
3. (ECG) data: This dataset includes electrocardiogram data collected from patients. I used this dataset to detect anomalies such as arrhythmias using DBSCAN.[Link](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000)
